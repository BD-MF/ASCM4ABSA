**ASCM4ABSA** - **A**spect-**s**pecific **C**ontext **M**odeling for **A**spect-**b**ased **S**entiment **A**nalysis
* Our code and proposed data (adversarial ABSA benchmark, dubbed *adv*ABSA) for [NLPCC 2022](http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2022/index.php) paper titled "[Aspect-specific Context Modeling for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08099.pdf)" 
* [Fang Ma](https://github.com/BD-MF), [Chen Zhang](https://genezc.github.io), [Bo Zhang](), and [Dawei Song](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/sdw/index.htm).

## *std*ABSA (Standard ABSA Benchmark)

* *std*ABSA contains datasets from SemEval for aspect-based Sentiment Classification (SC) and Opinion Extraction (OE) evaluation, namely Sem-SC and Sem-OE.

## *adv*ABSA (Adversarial ABSA Benchmark)

* Since there are only adversarial datasets for robust SC and not any for robust OE, we craft *adv*ABSA based on [xing2020tasty](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.292.pdf)'s datasets and methods. That is, *adv*ABSA can be decomposed to two parts, where the first part is Arts-SC reused from [xing2020tasty](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.292.pdf) and the second part is Arts-OE produced by us.
